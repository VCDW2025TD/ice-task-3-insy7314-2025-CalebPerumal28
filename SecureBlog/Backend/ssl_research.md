SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols that secure communication over the internet. TLS is the modern, more secure version that has replaced SSL in most applications today. HTTPS uses TLS to encrypt HTTP traffic, ensuring that data sent between a user and a server remains private and unaltered. Without HTTPS, attackers can intercept or modify traffic through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Many high-profile breaches, such as leaked login data or session hijacking, have occurred due to lack of SSL or poorly configured certificates. Using HTTPS is essential for any app handling user input, authentication, or sensitive data.
